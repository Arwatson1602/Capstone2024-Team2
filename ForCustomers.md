## Expectations for customers

The customer for a capstone project is the party who brings the expectations regarding the objectives. They may also give additional constraints. The customer may contribute as much or as little technical input as they desire. 

As two bounding examples regarding the level of expectations that a customer may impose:

The IEEE Southeast Convention robotics competition imposes the measures by which success if judged, operational environment, acceptable technologies, interface parameters, physical size constraints, powering constraints, et al. So, this level of specification represents an upper bound. 

The lower bound would be a fuzzy description of the objective ie. an autonomous robot to inspect typical crawl spaces. 


### Meeting with students

Throughout the semester students will need to meet with the customer. These meetings consist of an ongoing discussion regarding the customer's expectations, an update from the students, and any technical input (suggested technology, methods, standards, et al) from the customer. 

The students roughly follow the Nasa systems engineering handbook. The formulation stage of the project requires the students to iteratively define all stakeholder expectations in more and more precise terms. The goal is a set of "shall" statements which yield measureable design constraints. 

As an example of the formulation process followed by students, "inspect a typical crawl space" can be formulated further into "build a comprehensive view of a crawlspace which includes temperature, humidity, sub-floor wood moisture content, and a complete visual image of the sub-floor in crawl spaces between 8 and 32 inches high" (level of formulation typical during project proposal). This can be further formulated to define what humidity, temperature, and wood-moisture levels shall be measureable (assuming the total range is infeasible) and with what resolution (level of formulation required during conceptual design). 
 

### Feedback

The customer's feedback will be integrated into the evaluation of the team's performance.
