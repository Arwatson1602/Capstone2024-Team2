This document should be a markdown file that details all experiments which were conducted. The purpose of the experiment, a description of the experiment, the expected result of the experiment, and the number of trials (must be enough to establish statistically significant results) must be given for each of the experiments.

The results of the experiments should be given in an appropriate format. Data that is best suited to graphs must be in a graph. The same is true of tables. Results should not be given in paragraph format.
