# Final Deliverables


## Expectations for Improvements - due by the final presentation
Before the presentation, each team must have completed the agreed upon project improvements (including any necessary updates to the schematics, specs, and analysis). The team must conduct appropriate, statistically significant followup experiments. 

These improvements are a requirement and they must be informed by the experimentation results. However, the specific improvements must be tailored to the team. 

Completion of the improvements and the experimentation counts for 20% of the final report grade (late completion is not accepted).


### Extra credit for Improvements
Teams may also negotiate for extra credit improvements. These improvements have the same deadlines as the general improvements. The value of the the extra credit is at the discretion of the supervisor based on the merit of the improvement. 

The extra credit may not exceed 10% of the sum of the grade weights of the design phase 2 document, functional prototype, and experimentation. Currently this is $0.15*34 = 5.1$ . Equal distribution of the extra credit is awarded for the design, prototype, and experimentation ie. $5.1/3 = 1.7$ points per completion of appropriate improvements.

To meet this expectation, it is not necessary that the improvements function perfectly, but rather that the team made a decision informed by experimentation to move toward a design that works as desired, implemented this improved design, and experimented with it.



## Final Report Document - due 3 days after the final presentation

The final report must be in IEEE conference format (as expected with all previous documents).

Completion of final report document will count for 20% of the final report grade. Full credit will be given if the document is submitted on the due date. For each day late, a 20% deduction will be applied. 


**Introduction:**

· Background information 

		This can largely be copied with some updates from the proposal and phase 1

· Motivational Analysis 

		This can largely be copied from the proposal

· Problem Formulation

		This can largely be copied from the proposal

· Constraints 

		This can be copied from the proposal, phase 1, and phase 2

· Overall idea 

		This can be copied from the proposal

· Salient outcomes 

		This is required to be in this document and the github. Write it once and copy it to both places. 

· How the report is organized

		As you did in the proposal, explain the order and layout of this document.

**Literature Review:**

· Relevant literature either in the chronological order or evolution of new ideas

		This can be copied and updated from the proposal and phase 1. 

· Critical analysis on the literature – shortcomings (if any) 

		discuss what you intend to do different than what you found in the lit.

· Position/justify your work in the current state-of-the-art setting 

		discuss what you intend to do different than what you found in the lit.

· Engineering standards – copy and update

		This can be copied from the proposal and phase 1.

**Methodology:**

· Theory and Overall Idea of your Solution: 

· Complete Design Process

· _Does your methodology consider following items – If it does consider an item in the list then justify how you made that consideration. If it does not consider then state why you think this design does not require to consider this item (you design may not consider these items but you still need to justify why it does not require to consider these items): - copy and update_

o _Public Health_

o _Public Safety and Welfare_

o _Global, cultural, social, environmental and economic factors_



**Results and Discussion:**

· State the results in proper tabular, graphical or combination of both 

		The experimental results are already in journal entries as well as required in the github. Copy them here.

· What are the deliverables

		What did the team intend to deliver at the end of the project? What did you actually deliver?

**Timeline and Cost Estimates of the Project:**

· _State how the goals were set and what goals were set_

· _How the tasks were planned_

· _How often you reviewed the tasks and revised the goals when objectives were not met_

· _Explain all the process with the help of a Gant chart. – copy from github_

· _How you distributed the tasks among the group members_

· _Cost estimate and actual cost of the project – (e.g. development cost and production (per unit) cost) – copy from github_


**Ethical and Professional Responsibilities:**

· How your project warrants you to be aware of your ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations.

· Does your project consider global, economic, environmental and societal contexts and make informed judgments – one project may not consider all the contexts but you need to provide a justification why one item is more important over other in your particular project.


**Lessons Learned:**

· Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well? What unanticipated problems occurred? What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? What “best practices” have you identified? What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students? 


**Conclusions:**

· Summary of the project accomplishments. Conclusion which relates accomplishments to project objectives. Future directions the project could take.


**Appendix:**

· Additional material as appropriate.

· Individual statements – one per team member

o _List relevant knowledge and skills learned in other courses_

o _State what new knowledge you gained during the course of this project, how you acquired that knowledge, and how it is important to the project_
