Each signoff markdown file must give satisfy the following:

## Specifications

The specs and constraints for the relevant subsystem must be given. With this, the reasoning behind the specs must be given. As a few examples, specs may exist due to physics based limitations or requirements, other subsystem requirements, standards, ethics, or societal reasons. The clear and well developed line of reasoning must be given for the specs.

## Buildable pdf schematic 

A buildable pdf schematic must be embedded in the file. The schematic must be appropriate to the design. ie. 3d model for a physical system or wiring schematic for a circuit. 

## Analysis

A complete and relevant analysis of the design showing that it **should** meet the specs must be given. This analysis must be comprehensive and well explained so that it is convincing to the faculty supervisor. If the signoff request is not convincing either because the specs are insufficient, unjustified, or not appropriately shown to be met by the design, then approval will not be given. Without approval, the components for the subsystem aren't allowed to be ordered. 

## BOM

A complete list of all components needed for the design must be given with the cost of each component and the total cost of the subsystem.
