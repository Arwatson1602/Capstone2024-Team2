# Experimental Analysis

## Introduction 
The purpose of this report is to verify the requirements for the project and explain the procedures used to validate results. The results will be compared against the measures of success outlined in the project proposal to determine if the project was successful. This will also detail what the next steps are moving forward.

### Requirements

| Item | Constraint/Specification | Subsystem | 
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Shall Create an interceptor capable of functioning on its own without outside interaction. | All Subsystems |
| 2 | Shall Create an interceptor capable of wirelessly communicating with the sensor array. | Networking |
| 3 | Shall Create an interceptor capable of fitting inside a 1x1x1 foot box before powering on. | Housing |
| 4 | Shall Create an interceptor that poses no danger to spectators. | Mechanical Engineers |
| 5 | Shall Create an interceptor that includes a clearly marked power switch. | Housing |
| 6 | Shall Create an interceptor that includes clearly marked emergency stop option on the interceptor. | Housing |
| 7 | Shall Design a sensor array that can detect approaching objects and relay their locations to the interceptor.| Projectile Path Sensor and Velocity And Acceleration Sensor and Head On Position Sensor |
| 8 | Shall Design a sensor array that operates on battery power. | Projectile Path Sensor and Velocity And Acceleration Sensor |
| 9 | Shall Design an interceptor that complies with the safety checklist provided in the competition rules. | Housing |
| 10 | Shall Design an interceptor that has lights. | Housing |
| 11 | Shall Design an interceptor with decorations contributing to camouflaging of the device. | Housing |
| 12 | Shall Design an interceptor which plays an alert noise before firing. | Housing |
| 13 | Shall Design a network that has the capability to have up to six input devices. Due to having six sensor posts that must wirelessly communicate with the interceptor. | Networking |
| 14 | Shall Ensure the interceptor is wired correctly and consistently keeping uniform wire colors across devices. In order to ensure ease of troubleshooting. | All Subsystems |

## Results

### Constraint 1 - Autonomous
In order for this constraint to be met all subsystems must be able to run autonomously. Thus each subsystem must test and verify fully functioning while autonomous.
